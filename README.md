## BRCA genes history
"In 1990, scientist Mary-Claire King discovered the BRCA gene, which helped explain the high incidence of breast cancer among those with mutations in this gene. This gene is responsible for repairing mutations in the genome, and when a mutation occurs in it, the repair process is disrupted, leading to cancers. In 1995, another gene associated with breast cancer, BRCA2, was discovered, The BRCA1 gene is located on chromosome 17, and the BRCA2 gene is located on chromosome 13[1]

## BRCA genes mutation effect
We have two BRCA genes, one inherited from the father and the other from the mother. When a mutation occurs in these genes, it can increase the risk of cancer. For example, out of 10 women, more than 6 who have a harmful mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 will develop breast cancer. Additionally, a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 increases the risk of developing cancer in the opposite breast.[2]

## BRCA Genetic Testing
BRCA genetic testing is a blood test that uses DNA analysis to identify mutations in one of the breast cancer genes – BRCA1 and BRCA2. A positive result means that you carry a genetic mutation that increases your risk of cancer, and you can work with your doctor to manage this risk. A negative result may indicate that you do not carry the mutation."[3]

## options for reducing cancer risk

It is recommended for women with damage in the BRCA gene to undergo MRI screening. Additionally, surgical intervention to remove the ovaries and fallopian tubes may be necessary to reduce the risk of cancer. Medications like Tamoxifen and raloxifene may also be prescribed to lower the risk of cancer.[2]


## Who should consider genetic counseling and testing for inherited harmful changes in BRCA1 and BRCA2?

1. Individuals with family members who have mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2.
2. Individuals with a personal history of breast or ovarian cancer.
3. Women over the age of 50.

Experts recommend against BRCA testing for children under 18, as they are less likely to develop cancer due to a BRCA gene mutation.[2]
