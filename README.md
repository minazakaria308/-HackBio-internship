#BRCA genes history
"In 1990, scientist Mary-Claire King discovered the BRCA gene, which helped explain the high incidence of breast cancer among those with mutations in this gene. This gene is responsible for repairing mutations in the genome, and when a mutation occurs in it, the repair process is disrupted, leading to cancers. In 1995, another gene associated with breast cancer, BRCA2, was discovered.[1]

#BRCA genes mutation effect
We have two BRCA genes, one inherited from the father and the other from the mother. When a mutation occurs in these genes, it can increase the risk of cancer. For example, out of 10 women, more than 6 who have a harmful mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 will develop breast cancer. Additionally, a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 increases the risk of developing cancer in the opposite breast.[2]

#BRCA Genetic Testing
BRCA genetic testing is a blood test that uses DNA analysis to identify mutations in one of the breast cancer genes â€“ BRCA1 and BRCA2. A positive result means that you carry a genetic mutation that increases your risk of cancer, and you can work with your doctor to manage this risk. A negative result may indicate that you do not carry the mutation."[2]
